SimradIO
==========

SimradIO takes data from an SIMRAD EK60 echo sounder and plots it. Both 2D profile plots and 3D plots are available.

Sonar data can be provided in a raw file, or data can be aquired directly from the echo sounder. Our hardware for testing is a SIMRAD EK60 with one or two 7C split beam echo sounder.

SimradIO is written in Python. It uses Qt for the GUI as well as some database drivers etc. The 3D models and 2D charts are done with the Enthought Tool Suite (ETS); specifically Mayavi2 and Chaco.
